# This file contains settings for PingFederate's adaptive clustering
# capability. Please see the PingFederate Server Clustering Guide for more
# information on adaptive clustering. Settings in this file are ignored if
# adaptive clustering is disabled in run.properties. 

# Specifies the number of nodes each runtime state record will be replicated to.
# All cluster nodes must have the same value for this setting.
# A value of 2 provides data redundancy in case a single node fails.
# The recommended value is 3. Most runtime state requests wait for a response
# from a majority of the replica set. A value of 3 ensures that requests will
# not be delayed if a single node is slow to respond. 
replication.factor=3

# Determines whether this node will be used to store runtime state. By 
# default, all nodes store runtime state.
track.state=true

# Determines the timeout (in milliseconds) for requests related to runtime state
# rebalancing.
rebalance.rpc.timeout=5000

# Determines the group this node belongs to for adaptive clustering. If a group
# identifier is specified, this node will retrieve state only from other nodes
# with the same identifier. When a cluster spans multiple regions, it is
# recommended to assign nodes in different regions to different groups to avoid
# the latency impact of synchronously saving and retrieving state across
# regions. Asynchronous cross-group replication of state is enabled by default
# and controlled through settings later in this file.
#
# The node group identifier cannot contain whitespace, but all other characters
# are allowed. It is recommended to use a short string, such as a single
# character, to reduce the size of tokens that include this value.
node.group.id=${PF_NODE_GROUP_ID}

# Determines whether user sessions are replicated asynchronously to other node
# groups. This includes adapter session attributes, authentication sessions and
# SLO-related data.
inter.group.replicate.sessions=true

# Determines whether OAuth reference tokens are replicated to other node groups.
inter.group.replicate.reference.tokens=true

# By default, reference tokens are replicated synchronously, to ensure they can
# be immediately validated on other node groups. If this is not necessary, you
# can change the replication mode to asynchronous. This will reduce the time
# taken to create a token.
inter.group.replicate.reference.tokens.synchronous=true

# Determines whether assertion replay state is replicated asynchronously to
# other node groups.
inter.group.replicate.assertion.replay=true

# Determines whether account locking state is replicated asynchronously to other
# node groups.
inter.group.replicate.account.locking=true

# Determines whether SSO transaction state is replicated asynchronously to other
# node groups.
inter.group.replicate.transaction.state=false
