This profile was created with the manage-profile generate-profile subcommand.
It was generated at 29/Apr/2020:20:53:30.952 +0000 by user centos, from the
server in /ds/dg2.

Certain steps will always need to be taken to use this generated profile with
the manage-profile tool. The generated profile includes a setup-arguments.txt
file that contains variables, such as ${PING_INSTANCE_NAME}. When using this
profile with the manage-profile tool, values for those variables will need to
be provided using either a profile variables file or environment variables. See
manage-profile setup --help for more information on providing variable values.
In addition, file-based arguments in setup-arguments.txt, such as
--rootUserPasswordFile, must have the necessary files available when the
profile is run. The provided PING_PROFILE_ROOT and PING_SERVER_ROOT variables
can be used when referring to those files.

Other steps may need to be taken depending on the generated profile. Additional
files can be added to the generated profile, such as server root files, server
SDK extensions, and dsconfig commands. The profile can be modified as necessary
for documentation and organization.

For more information on the server profile, see the example profile template
and README in the resource/ directory in the server root.

The following files and directories in the server root were excluded from the
generated profile, and can be manually added if necessary. These files can also
be included by generate-profile with the --includePath argument:
config/encryption-settings/encryption-settings-db
config/tools.properties
config/keystore
config/keystore.pin
config/truststore
config/ads-truststore.pin
config/ads-truststore
config/encryption-settings.pin
password.file
config/truststore.pin
