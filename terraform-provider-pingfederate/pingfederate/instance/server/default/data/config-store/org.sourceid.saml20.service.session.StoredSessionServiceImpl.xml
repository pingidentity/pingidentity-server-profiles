    <!--To precisely enforce idle timeouts, the last activity time must be updated each time user activity is detected.

        By default, the last activity time in the data store will only be updated if less than 75% of any persistent
        session’s idle timeout remains(i.e., threshold is 0.25). Hence, going beyond that 0.25 threshold is how we know
        that less than 75% of the idle timeout remains.

        Default configuration:
        <c:item name="IdleTimeoutExtensionThreshold">0.25</c:item>-->
    <c:item name="IdleTimeoutExtensionThreshold">0.25</c:item>
    <c:item name="SessionGroupIdLength">25</c:item>
    <!--The maximum number of session groups per unique user key allowed before session groups with the oldest last activity time
        are deleted from session storage.

        Please be aware that enabling this feature may impact performance on your session storage in cases where there is
        a large number of existing session groups. Each time a user creates a new session, this feature will check and possibly
        request your session storage to delete session groups for that user. These requests to retrieve and remove session groups
        can increase the load on your session storage.

        A value of -1 indicates that no limit should be enforced.

        Default configuration:
        <c:item name="MaxSessionGroupsPerUniqueUserKey" defaultForUpgrade="-1">100</c:item>-->
    <c:item defaultForUpgrade="-1" name="MaxSessionGroupsPerUniqueUserKey">100</c:item>
    <!--The maximum number of session groups to delete once the maximum number of session groups per unique user key
        limit is reached.

        Default configuration:
        <c:item name="MaxSessionGroupsToRemove">50</c:item>-->
    <c:item name="MaxSessionGroupsToRemove">50</c:item>
